             <p>Colman has been a software developer for several months now. He has enjoyed how to creatively problem 
                 solve to find beautiful answers to complex problems. He is currently on the job hunt while learning 
                 new skills during this pandemic. When not writing code he enjoys exploring new restaurants, breweries, 
                 playing with his dog and learning.</p>
