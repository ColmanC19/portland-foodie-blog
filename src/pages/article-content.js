            `Go for the pressure cooked chicken(that you coulda swore was deep fried)
             and stay for the ambiance. A good ole fashoined dive bar 
             in the classic sense. Warning, the chicken takes a long time.
             That'll give you more time to work up an appetite while you 
             play pool or catch a game.`,
            `2) 2) Roscoes`,
            `8105 SE Stark St Open 11A-2:30A Daily`,
            `A criminally underrated beer bar (way back in 2014 they 
            were the first to have crux on draft) that serves some dang good
            down home fare. Po boys, shrimp n grits, and whatever you do, 
            get the mac and cheese. The large order. `,

            everybody. Teryaki chicken? Yup. Beef stroganoff? Check.
            Enchiladas? You betcha. At reasonable prices and a casual 
            dining room atmosphere it should be illegal to not go.`,

            a timbers game. Or really for just about any occasion. Delicious 
            wood fired pies, fresh salads and sensibly priced wine. Don't

            louisianna fare. And the service is what you would expect from 
            our gentile hosts down south. Sip a sazerac while you pop
            hushpuppies down your gullet and you'll be sure to sleep 
            soundly, dreaming of that ooey gooey mac and cheese.`,

            sweet potato and fried shallots. And if it's too spicy
            it's conveniently located in the Baerlic beer pod 
            where you can find some suds to wash it all down.`,
